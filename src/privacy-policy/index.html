    <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
    <p>
        The purpose of this privacy policy is to be transparent and give an accurate detail of how the website handles the data you provide while using it.
    </p>

    <h3>Information collected</h3>
    <p>
        No information is collected or sent remotely by the application. For enhanced user experience and performance, some information is locally stored.<br />
        This primarily includes <b>the metadata of past locations the user has entered in the application</b>. The user's current location is not stored. For every visit, the application tries to get the current location again.
        None of the timing for actions is stored. When a user selects a location as a starting/drop location, we use Google API services to get a name and ID of the location. To prevent avoidable API calls to Google and reduce costs, this [Name, ID, Coordinates] data is stored locally so on subsequent visit, if the application notices the user is closer to any of these past locations, instead of showing a lat,lng coordinate it shows the name of the place.<br />
        This data is not used for any other inferences, not linked to the device/session, or user in any way.
    </p>


    <h3>Details of data use</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Cookies</b>: The application does not use cookies<br />
        <b>Inputs</b>: None of the inputs provided on the site are persistent.<br />
        <b>Server</b>: The application is entirely client-based and hence does not store information on the server.<br />
        <b>Local storage</b>: The browser provided <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API">Web storage API</a> for persistent data across user sessions is used to store the information listed above. This data is not accessible by the server or other sites.<br />
        <b>Advertisers</b>: We do not show advertisements in the site nor do we work with third-party advertisers. If you notice an ad, it is likely injected by a browser extension and could be malicious.<br />
        <b>Mapbox</b>: The mapping library we use in the website stores two values in the local storage which are sent to their servers. This is anonymous and not linked to the application data in any way.
    </p>
